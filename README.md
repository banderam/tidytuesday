# tidytuesday

This repo is a collection of my #TidyTuesday code and visualisations.
#TidyTuesday is a project organized by the `R4DS Online Learning Community`, that emphasize on understanding how to summarize, arrange and visualize data by leveraging the tools available in the `tidyverse` ecosystem. 

#### 2021 Week 13 - UN Votes
Using the data from [Harvard's Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:1902.1/12379): "United Nations General Assembly Voting Data", I focused on lone votes, to explore how many times a country stood alone at the United Nations.

#### 2021 Week 15 - Deforestation
This week TidyTuesday was about Forest and Deforestation. The data comes from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/forests-and-deforestation): Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser (2021) - "Forests and Deforestation".
I used the data about Net forest conversion in every countries and joined them with their young population data from the [Data World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.0014.TO), trying to spot some curious details.
